# Movie-Database-PyQt

While I was waiting for my car to be serviced, I decided to put together a PyQt Movie Database based on a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle. The datbase holds over 6000 movies from 1980 to 2020. THe link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies

To use the PyQt version, you must have PyQt5 installed: pip install PyQt5

# Uses
1) To run via the command line, run main.py
2) To use the PyQt desktop version, run MainWindow.py
